# intro

Use this prompt to draft a persona from research evidence.

# context

- **Persona name** — short identifier for the persona (e.g. "Field operator", "Watch officer"). Becomes `{{persona-name}}`.

# inputs

@@if confluence@@
- Search for interview transcripts, observation notes, or survey responses in the programme's Confluence space. Look for pages under *Interviews*, *Field notes*, *Sessions*, *Surveys* (or with `interview`, `observation`, `session-notes` in titles).

- Read the Themes and Friction-points sections of `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Research-synthesis` if available. These sharpen the persona's pains and goals.
- Show the user what you found and ask them to confirm or refine the set before reading in detail.
- In copy-paste mode: ask the user to paste interview transcripts (mark sessions with `--- Session [N] / [role] ---`) plus the Themes and Friction-points sections of the Research-synthesis page if available.

# draft

A good persona:
- Names a specific archetype, not a vague "user"
- Roots every claim in evidence (cite the Session IDs that back it)
- Has goals about outcomes, not features
- Surfaces how the archetype *varies* rather than flattening it to an average
- Marks thin/contested areas rather than inventing to fill the shape

Use this fuller structure, one `##` section per heading. Fill only the sections the evidence supports; where it's thin, keep the heading and flag the gap with `[thin]`/`[open]`/`[provisional]` rather than inventing.

### [Persona name — specific, memorable; not "User A"]

- **Snapshot** — 2-3 lines: who they are, where they sit, what they're accountable for, and the one hard part of the job. Cite the sessions.
- **Role and context** — the job as done: environment, tools, who they work with, cadence. Evidence per claim.
- **Goals** — outcome-focused, 3-5. Each with evidence.
- **How they vary** — the axes of variation the data actually shows (e.g. seniority, shift, a formative incident) — not a forced demographic split. Use direct quotes to show the range. Flag small cohorts as directional.
- **Mental model of the system** — how they believe the system/process works, including where that model is wrong or distrusted. Evidence.
- **Pains** — 3-5, with evidence and (where the synthesis provides it) severity/frequency.
- **Behaviours the design needs to support** — what any solution must accommodate, drawn from the above. Evidence.
- **Variations and non-personas** — adjacent roles seen in the data but not this persona, and explicitly who was *not* studied (mark `[open]`).
- **Evidence table** — one row per source (Session ID · profile · note link), plus a synthesis row and any cross-programme row.

If the research notes don't support a section, keep the heading and mark the gap — don't invent. End with the `## Sources` section (per Output discipline).

# tips

- Don't ask for multiple personas in one go. Generate one at a time and let each one earn its place.
- The "non-obvious trait" check matters because personas blur into one another when every persona is a "busy professional who values efficiency." The differentiating trait is what makes the persona useful in design discussions.
- The persona output feeds directly into the [journey-map drafter](/prompts/journey-map-drafter), [service-blueprint drafter](/prompts/service-blueprint-drafter), and [PRD generator](/prompts/prd-generator).
