# intro

Use this prompt to turn an operational scenario into a structured capability specification — measurable requirements derived from operational need.

# context

- **Operational scenario** — page reference under `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Operational scenarios/*` to base the spec on.
- **Capability name** — short (e.g. "Tank-crew alerting aid", "Fighter aircraft sensor-fusion module", "Frigate surface-contact classifier"). Becomes `{{capability-name}}`.

# inputs

- Read the operational scenario at the path the user named (fall back to `Knowledge Base/Programme-wide/Operational scenarios/*` if no track-level version exists).
@@if confluence@@
- Find the capability brief or statement of operational need — under *Briefs*, *Capability*, *Mission* (or with `capability-brief`, `operational-need`, `mission-statement` in titles).
- Look for known constraints — under *Constraints*, *Compliance*, *Architecture* (or with `constraints`, `regulatory`, `integration` in titles).

- Show the user what you found and ask them to confirm or refine before reading in detail.
- In copy-paste mode: ask for the operational scenario, the capability brief, and any known measurable thresholds (accuracy, latency, recall, classification, etc.).

# draft

A good capability spec:
- Names requirements that the operational scenario actually demands. Every requirement traces back to a scenario beat.
- Is measurable. "System shall be usable" is not a requirement; "operator completes the primary task within 90 seconds in degraded lighting" is.
- Distinguishes functional, performance, and environmental requirements
- Names constraints honestly (regulatory, integration, schedule)
- Leaves implementation choices open. Specify the WHAT, not the HOW.

Output as markdown:

## Capability spec: [capability name]

### Operational basis
- **Scenario:** [page link or title]
- **Primary mission task supported:** [from scenario]

### Functional requirements
- **FR-1:** [requirement] — traces to scenario beat: [which one]
- **FR-2:** [requirement] — traces to: [...]

### Performance requirements
- **PR-1:** [measurable threshold] — [rationale + evidence]
- **PR-2:** ...

### Environmental requirements
- **ER-1:** [environment] — [tolerance / behaviour required]
- **ER-2:** ...

### Constraints
- **C-1:** [constraint] — [origin: regulatory / integration / schedule]

### Open questions
- [question]

### Out-of-scope (explicit)
- [thing this capability does NOT need to do]

If the scenario doesn't justify a requirement, leave it out and flag under Open questions. Don't invent.

# tips

- When you review CLARA's spec, every requirement should trace back to a specific scenario beat. Challenge any that can't — that's where drift creeps in.
- Performance thresholds are where CLARA's draft will be vaguest unless your operational scenario contains hard numbers. Push for measurable thresholds ("within 5 seconds, 95th percentile") rather than "fast enough".
- Pair CLARA's output with a [Napkin AI](/tools/napkin-ai) system diagram so the requirements have a structural picture to anchor against.
