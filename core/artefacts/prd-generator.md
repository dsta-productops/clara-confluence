# intro

Use this prompt to draft a first-pass PRD from research synthesis and stakeholder context.

# context

- **PRD title** — short (e.g. "Incident-report capture v1"). Becomes `{{prd-title}}`.

# inputs

- Read the Problem-statement and Success-criteria sections of `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Research-synthesis` (fall back to programme-wide when no track-level version exists).
- Look up the persona at `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Personas/*` (fall back to programme-wide). Ask the user which persona if multiple.
- Optionally read the Themes section of `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/Research-synthesis` (or programme-wide).
@@if confluence@@
- Find the original stakeholder ask — programme brief / charter / requesting note. Pages with `brief`, `ask`, `charter` in titles.

# draft

Produce a PRD using this structure, one `##` heading per section:

1. **Problem statement** (1 paragraph) — framed as a problem, not a solution in disguise; names who has the problem.
2. **Target users / operators** — link to the specific persona page(s); no implicit "the user".
3. **Goals and non-goals** — what this release is trying to achieve, and what it is explicitly *not* doing (contested or out-of-evidence items go under non-goals, with the reason).
4. **In scope / out of scope** — bounded both ways; "out of scope" usually shortens later debates.
5. **User stories** — one `###` sub-heading per story, labelled `User story N — <short title>`. Under each, in this order:
   - The story itself, phrased as an outcome (`As a <persona>, when <situation>, I want <capability>, so <benefit>.`) — not a feature.
   - **Why this priority** — the evidence and ranking rationale (severity/frequency, which sessions support it).
   - **Independent test** — how this story could be validated on its own, without the other stories being built first.
   - **Acceptance scenarios** — Given/When/Then bullets; flag any `[contested]` / `[research gap]` / `[assumption]` inline rather than inventing.
6. **Success criteria** (measurable, capability-focused) — what the capability has to be able to do, and to what threshold. No "users will feel more confident" non-criteria.
7. **Constraints and dependencies** — every external thing the work depends on; re-read with "what would block this?" in mind.
8. **Open questions** — honest unknowns; the first draft is meant to be wrong in interesting ways.

Rules:
- Where input is incomplete, ask the user up to 3 clarifying questions BEFORE drafting. Don't invent details.
- Keep prose sections to 1-2 paragraphs; user stories are as many as the evidence supports, ordered by priority.
- If you'd be guessing, put a placeholder and flag it under "Open questions."

Output as markdown.

# filing

@@if confluence@@
- Create a new page at `Knowledge Base/{{track}}/PRDs/{{prd-title}}`. Link to the problem statement, success criteria, and persona pages.
- In copy-paste mode: return the markdown and the user will file it manually.

# tips

- CLARA asks clarifying questions when inputs are thin. Answer honestly even if it's "I don't know yet" — the Open questions section preserves the unknown.
- Treat CLARA's v0 PRD as a starting position, not a final document. Manual editing after generation is the norm, not the exception.

## Before you circulate — self-review checklist

Before sharing the PRD with stakeholders, walk through these checks. Most teams will edit the draft directly to fix gaps; a few questions surface things the draft can't fix on its own.

- **Problem statement** is one paragraph, framed as a problem (not a solution in disguise). Has a clear "who has the problem."
- **Success criteria** are measurable and capability-focused — what the capability or product has to be able to do, and to what threshold. No "users will feel more confident" non-criteria.
- **Scope** is bounded both ways — what's in *and* what's out. "Out of scope" usually shortens later debates.
- **User stories / jobs-to-be-done** describe outcomes, not features.
- **Constraints and dependencies** name every external thing the work depends on. Re-read with "what would block this?" in mind.
- **Open questions** are honest. The first draft is supposed to be wrong in interesting ways; the open questions are where you flag what you don't know.
- **Persona references** link to specific persona pages — no implicit "the user".
