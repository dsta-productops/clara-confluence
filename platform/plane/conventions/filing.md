# Filing — artefacts and field notes

## Write scope and read scope

**Write scope** — CLARA files artefacts and field notes only within the programme's own Plane project, under the `Knowledge Base` page hierarchy. CLARA never files outside the programme project without explicit user confirmation.

**Read scope** — CLARA reads from any Plane project (and any other source) accessible to the user. When synthesising artefacts or building Prior-knowledge summaries, CLARA may draw on content from adjacent programme projects, cross-programme repositories, or any other source the user points it to. The programme project boundary applies to writing only.

This is the **write-narrow, read-wide** principle.

## Project resolution

Plane projects are named after their programme. CLARA resolves the project by listing projects and matching the programme name supplied at the start of each run (per `conventions/context.md`) against the project name (e.g. `SKYPROTECT` → identifier `SKYPR`). No project mapping is stored anywhere; the lookup happens at runtime on every run.

## Filing flow — artefacts

For every artefact CLARA drafts:

1. **Draft** — CLARA produces the artefact content in the CLI.
2. **State target path** — before asking for confirmation, CLARA states the full target path: `Knowledge Base / {{track}} / <artefact-type> / <name>`.
3. **Confirm** — CLARA asks: *"File to Plane?"* If any parent nodes along the target path are missing, CLARA lists them in the same prompt as placeholders it will create first (e.g. *"Missing parents I'll create as placeholders: `Operator-console`, `Personas`"*). The user reviews the path, the placeholder list, and confirms in one go — no separate prompt per placeholder.
4. **Create** — CLARA creates any disclosed placeholders top-down (creating each page, then nesting it under the node above via the browser connection), then the leaf page at the target path, writes its body via the browser connection, and returns the page URL.
5. **Update case** — if a page already exists at the target path, CLARA asks whether to update in place (edit the body via the browser connection; Plane's page version history preserves the prior version) or create a new draft at an alternative path. CLARA never silently overwrites.

## Setup detection

At the start of any artefact or synthesis run, CLARA checks whether a `Knowledge Base` page exists in the programme project.

**If no Knowledge Base is found:**

CLARA stops and informs the user:

> *"There's no Knowledge Base set up for [programme] yet. I'll need to do that before I can file anything. Should I run setup-kb now?"*

- If yes — CLARA runs the setup-kb flow inline (see `conventions/setup-kb.md`), then proceeds to the notes checkpoint below.
- If no — CLARA drafts the artefact but holds filing. It warns the user that nothing will be filed until the KB exists.

## Notes checkpoint

When synthesis is invoked and the Field-notes node has no note children (including immediately after setup-kb completes), CLARA presents three options before proceeding:

> *"Before I can synthesise, I need your field notes. How would you like to proceed?*
> *(a) Point me to pages or pages anywhere in Plane — I'll file them as notes under the Field-notes node*
> *(b) Paste a transcript here — I'll file it as a field-note page*
> *(c) You'll add notes under the Field-notes node yourself — let me know when they're ready"*

**Option (a)** — CLARA reads the user-pointed source (from any project), creates a structured Field-note page under `Field-notes` using the standard template, stamps a Session ID, and (with per-item confirmation) leaves a back-link comment on the original pointing to the KB copy. CLARA then proceeds directly into synthesis. The note is cited by its Session ID (see `conventions/field-notes.md`).

**Option (b)** — CLARA receives the pasted transcript, creates a Field-note page under `Field-notes`, then proceeds directly into synthesis.

**Option (c)** — CLARA stops, gives the user the Field-notes node URL, and instructs them to invoke synthesis again once notes are in place.

For options (a) and (b), see `conventions/field-notes.md` for the template structure and citation convention.

## User-pointed notes — cross-project filing

When the user points CLARA at source material under option (a), it may live in any Plane project. CLARA reads from the source location and files a structured copy as a page into the programme KB. The original is never moved, deleted, or overwritten — those operations are forbidden by the external-content read-only guardrail in `persona.md`.

After the KB copy is filed, CLARA *offers* to add a back-link notice (as a comment) to the original:

> *"Structured copy filed at [link] by CLARA on [date]. Edit the KB copy going forward."*

This is an additive write to external content, so it requires explicit user confirmation per source item. CLARA asks once per item (or once per batch with a "yes to all / skip all" option if multiple sources are in play). If the user declines, the KB copy still stands; only the back-link notice is skipped.
